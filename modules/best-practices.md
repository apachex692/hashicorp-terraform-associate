# Best Practices

1. **Avoid Manual State File Changes:** The state file in Terraform is a JSON file that tracks the current state of infrastructure. It’s tempting to make direct edits to this file, but it can lead to unexpected results.
   - **Practice:** Only change the state file through Terraform command execution to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. **Use Shared Remote Storage for State Files:** When working in a team, the state file should be accessible to all team members to execute Terraform commands.
   - **Practice:** Configure a shared remote storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Terraform Cloud, Azure, Google Cloud) for the state file. This ensures that every team member can access and update the latest state file.
3. **Enable State File Locking:** Concurrent changes to the state file can cause conflicts.
   - **Practice:** Lock the state file during updates to prevent concurrent edits. Many storage backends, like Amazon S3 with DynamoDB, support automatic state file locking.
4. **Backup State Files:** Losing the state file can disrupt the infrastructure management.
   - **Practice:** Enable versioning for the state file in your remote storage. This allows for backup and recovery of previous state versions, ensuring continuity even if the state file is lost or corrupted.
5. **Use Dedicated State Files per Environment:** Managing multiple environments (development, testing, production) with a single state file can be confusing and error-prone.
   - **Practice:** Use separate state files for each environment, each with its own storage backend configured with locking and versioning.

## Best Practices for Managing Terraform Code

1. **Host Terraform Code in Git Repositories:** Effective collaboration requires sharing and versioning the Terraform code.
   - **Practice:** Store Terraform code in its own Git repository, similar to application code. This facilitates collaboration, version control, and tracking changes.
2. **Implement Code Review and Testing for Terraform Changes:** Directly committing changes to Terraform code without review can introduce errors.
   - **Practice:** Treat Terraform code like application code by implementing a review and testing process using merge requests and continuous integration (CI) pipelines. This ensures that changes are reviewed and tested before being integrated.
3. **Execute Terraform Commands in a Continuous Deployment Pipeline:** Manually applying changes can lead to inconsistencies.
   - **Practice:** Use a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline to execute Terraform commands and apply infrastructure changes. This standardizes the process and ensures changes are applied consistently from a single location.

These best practices aim to make Terraform workflows more robust, collaborative, and efficient, helping teams manage infrastructure more effectively.
